# Credit Default via Deep Learning

Traditionally, banks use non-time dependency models, such as linear models, to deal with credit scoring problems. However, the models would not be robust for more complicated real-world data and applications. Thus, we would like to leverage time-related deep learning models to provide better insights for this problem.

We use Default of Credit Cards Clients Dataset collected by UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information on default payments,demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. We would like to understand the features' insights before we put into the deep learning models. Thus, with featuresâ€™ names for each columns, we believe this dataset would provide us more insights than most of other datasets that only have anonymous features.
