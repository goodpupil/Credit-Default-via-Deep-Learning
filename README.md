# Credit Default via Deep Learning

We implemented Deep-Time series features extraction model on the Default of Credit Cards Clients Dataset ( UCI Machine Learning Repository ). The traditional prediction, such as logistic regression, can beimproved by using our data-preprocessing method andtime-correlated features extraction model of LSTM+DNN. As a result, we should check for time-correlated relationship for credit-carddefault data like this in the future. Please check out the report and slides for more information.
